In this post I am going to write about SVM, which stands for Support Vector Machine. This is a very important tool in the Machine Learning cenario, but it is also very simple. Let's delve into it!

{% highlight ruby %}
def loss(X, y, W, delta)
  prints "Support Vector Machine Loss Function"
end
loss(X, y, W, delta)
#=> prints 'Support Vector Machine Loss Function'
{% endhighlight %}
